# **LifeTrack – AI-Powered Health & Lifestyle Monitoring Syste**

## **Title of the Project**
**LifeTrack – AI-Enhanced health monitoring system**

---

## **Small Description**
LifeTrack is an AI-powered health monitoring platform designed to track daily activities, analyze habits, and generate personalized predictions to help users maintain a healthier lifestyle.

---

## **About**
**LifeTrack** is an intelligent health and lifestyle management system that automatically tracks a user’s daily steps, calorie intake, sleep duration, and other wellness metrics.

The system utilizes machine learning models to analyze behavioral patterns and generate meaningful insights such as weekly activity forecasts and personalized recommendations.

Traditional self-tracking requires multiple apps and manual data entry, often leading to inconsistent and ineffective monitoring. LifeTrack solves this by providing:
- An integrated dashboard  
- Automated predictions  
- Visual insights  

All combined into one seamless and user-friendly health monitoring platform.

---

## **Features**
- Advanced Machine Learning prediction models  
- Real-time monitoring of health metrics  
- Interactive dashboards with charts and visual insights  
- Personalized recommendations based on user behavior  
- High scalability and optimized data processing  
- Clean modular architecture with Django backend
